    <p style="color:rgb(119, 0, 255)">
        Shri P.A.C.Ramasamy Raja (24th April 1894 - 3rd Sep 1962) set up the first cement plant in 1961 in
        Virudhunagar district, Tamil Nadu, which is now named after him and called Ramasamy Raja Nagar. The state
        government, for the first time in the history of India, invested in his company, an indication of total trust
        and implicit faith the government had in him. His sharp focus on technology and quality has inspired a
        generation of entrepreneurs and formed the basis for the collective vision of the group.
